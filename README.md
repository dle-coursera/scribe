## How to use
1. Open the system console by going to `Applications -> Utilities -> Console`

3. In Sketch, go to `Plugin -> Scribe -> Generate Component`
4. Observe the logs
5. In a separate terminal window, run `npm run serve` and browse to `localhost:3000` to get a live preview of components generated by Scirbe.

## Development
During development, you'll want to communicate with Sketch APIs. Since Sketch is an Objective-c app, we can retrieve header files for all of their classes. Use this as reference to find the APIs that you need. [Sketch class-dump](https://github.com/dle-coursera/sketch-class-dump).

Any class that as a `MS` prefix is a Sketch object ex. `MSArtboard`. Any object that's prefixed as `NS` and `CG` are Apple objects. Ex. `NSDocument` and `CGRect`. Google Apple classes to find relevant documentation for them.
